# landing-page
In this project I will replicate a website page based on the images below as references.

![Final-product](./final-product.png)
![Colors-and-fonts](./colors_fonts.png)

The main focus is to become more comfortable with the flex toolbox.

At the end of this project I will have more confidence in using it and in having a better discerning eye: by looking at a page I will be able to estabilish more easily which CSS properties to use in order to achieve the result.
